# Unofficial Cuentica API Documentation Extractor

⚠️ **DISCLAIMER: This is an unofficial repository and almost everything in this repo is generated by AI. Use at your own risk.**

This project provides a basic tool to convert the Cuentica API documentation into a more accessible HTML version that is more easily convertible to Markdown format. The project was created to address the challenges of crawling and converting the original Cuentica API documentation, which uses JavaScript for dynamic content expansion.

The outputs of this project are
- A Postman collection for Cuentica's API
- A Markdown version of the documentation that can be easily used as context for an LLM.

## Background & Workflow

The conversion process involved several steps due to the complexity of the original documentation:

1. **HTML Preprocessing** (`preprocess_html.js`):
   - The original Cuentica API page couldn't be directly crawled (or I didn't know how) because API responses are collapsed by default
   - JavaScript execution was required to expand the responses
   - This script pre-expands all responses and generates `cuentica_api_expanded.html`
   - Note: Alternative attempts using Firecrawl were unsuccessful (see `apidocs_cuentica_firecrawl.md`)

2. **HTML to Markdown Conversion**:
   - Initial attempts using turndown.js didn't produce satisfactory results
   - After testing various Large Language Models (LLMs), Gemini 2.5 Pro was chosen for its large context window
   - The entire HTML file (340K tokens) was processed by Gemini to extract endpoints into `cuentica_api_expanded_cleaned.md`

3. **Postman Collection Generation**:
   - The final Postman collection was generated using Cursor with Claude 3.5 Sonnet

## Features
